# regex-pcre-text

This package extends regex-base and `regex-pcre` to work with `Text`
in the same way that `regex-tdfa-text` does. It uses the `regex-base`
`Text` instances provided by `regex-tdfa-text`.


## usage with regex

To use it with `regex` just make sure you are using `regex-with-pcre`
`1.0.1.0` or later.


## credits

This code is based on the code for `regex-pcre` by Christopher Kuklewicz.
